Many people take pictures of different city landmarks and post them to photo-sharing systems like Flickr. They also add tags and place photos in Flickr groups, created around particular themes. Using tags, other people can search for representative landmark images of places of interest. Searching for landmarks using tags results into many non-landmark photos and provides poor landmark summary for a city. In this paper we propose a new method to identify landmark photos using tags and social Flickr groups. In contrast to similar modern systems, our approach is also applicable when GPS-coordinates for photos are not available. Presented user study shows that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art systems for landmark finding.
