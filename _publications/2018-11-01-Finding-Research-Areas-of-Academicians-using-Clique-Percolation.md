Identifying research areas of academicians is a challenging task. Most of the researchers have used supervised machine learning to handle this task which requires labelled data. In this paper, we propose to use clique percolation (an overlapping community detection algorithm) to identify research areas of academicians. We propose a framework to collect data from digital libraries and websites of selected universities in Pakistan. We then identify researchers working in multiple research areas using clique percolation and present results of our analyses.
