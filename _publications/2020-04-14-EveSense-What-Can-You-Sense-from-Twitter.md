Social media has become a useful source for detecting real-life events. This paper presents an event detection application EveSense. It detects real-life events and related trending topics from the Twitter stream and allows users to find interesting events that have recently occurred. It uses a novel Dynamic Heartbeat Graph (DHG) approach, which efficiently extracts distinguishing features and performs better than the existing event detection methods. We tested and evaluated the application on three case studies, including a sports event (FA cup Final) and two political events (Super Tuesday and US Election).
