abstract = "Rising stars in any field are the persons that have the potential to become popular in near future. Exploring rising stars in any organization will help the organization in their decisions making. Concept of rising star has been applied for finding rising authors in research community, rising business managers in telecommunication industry and rising players in the game of cricket. In this paper we presented the rising star prediction in basketball as a machine learning problem. We presented three types of co-players: co-players of same team in same game, co-players of opponent team in same game and co-players of both same and opponent team in same game. Co-players statistics are used as features for machine learning models. The co-player features are classified by feature size and type, which are further divided into different categories. Derived features along with their mathematical formulation are presented, that are derived from players statistics. The impact of co-players on prediction of rising star is measured through various machine learning models. Experimental results shows that derived features are dominant on different datasets in terms of F-measure score. The highest F-measure score achieved by derived features is 96%. Comparison of different machine learning models shows that Maximum Entropy Markov Model is dominant on all datasets in terms of F-measure score. The highest F-measure score achieved by Maximum Entropy Markov Model is 96%. Ranking comparison shows that most of the labeled rising stars are ranked in the top 100 in the subsequent six seasons. Comparison of rising stars with NBA (National Basketball Association) most improved players shows that rising stars have better efficiency in those seasons for which NBA most improved players were selected."

abstract={Manual testing of software requirements written in natural language for agile or any other methodology requires more time and human resources. This leaves the testing process error prone and time consuming. For satisfied end users with bug‐free software delivered on time, there is a need to automate the test oracle process for natural language or informal requirements. The automation of the test oracle is relatively easier with formal requirements, but this task is difficult to achieve with natural language requirements. This study proposes an approach called Restricted Natural Language Agile Requirements Testing (ReNaLART) to automate the test oracle from restricted natural language agile requirements. For this purpose, it uses an existing user story template with some modifications for writing user stories. This helps in identifying test input and expected output for a user story. For comparison of expected and observed outputs it makes use of a regex pattern and string distance functions. It is capable of assigning different types of verdicts automatically depending upon the similarity/dissimilarity between observed and expected outputs of user stories. ReNaLART is validated using several case studies of different domains, namely, OLX Pakistan, Mental Health Tests, McDelivery Pakistan, BlueStacks, Power Searching with Google, TensorFlow Playground, w3Schools 2018 offline and Touch'D. It revealed several faults in five of the above listed eight applications. Plus, the proposed test oracle on an average took 0.02s for test data generation, expected output generation and verdict assignment. Both these facts show the fault revealing effectiveness and efficiency of ReNaLART.}

    abstract={Social media are widely used as communication platforms in the world of business. Twitter, in particular, offers valuable opportunities for collaboration due to its open nature. For that, many entrepreneurs employ Twitter for different reasons, such as mobilizing financial resources, get funding, and increase their innovation capabilities. Therefore, they keep looking for local entrepreneurial accounts to help them. Messages from entrepreneurial influencers -opinion leader- increase the information diffusion to entrepreneurs, helping them to find more opportunities. Discovering the characteristics of entrepreneurial influencers in Twitter networks becomes extremely important since it reflects the way to reach entrepreneurs. In the present paper, we propose a novel framework called ECharacterize based on feature selections techniques to discover the characteristics of the entrepreneurial influencer in the Saudi context in a robust manner. The framework extracts abundant influencers’ features and then employs seven state-of-the-art ranking methods to determine the characteristics of the most relevant influencer. It robustly aggregates the lists to come out with the accurate final list using Robust Rank Aggregation. The framework examined on 233,018 real-life Arabic tweets. The results show the ability of the proposed method to distinguish between the influencers by their popularity, reliability and activity level. }

abstract={Social media analytics has experienced significant growth over the past few years due to the crucial importance of analyzing and measuring public social behavior on different social networking sites. Twitter is one of the most popular social networks and means of online news that allows users to express their views and participate in a wide range of different issues in the world. Expressed opinions on Twitter are based on diverse experiences that represent a broad set of valuable data that can be analyzed and used for many purposes. This study aims to understand the public discussions that are conducted on Twitter about essential topics and developing an analytics framework to analyze these discussions. The focus of this research is the analytical framework of Arabic public discussions using the hashtag #SaudiWomenCanDrive, as one of the hot trends of Twitter discussions. The proposed framework analyzed more than two million tweets using methods from social network analysis. The framework uses the metrics of graph centrality to reveal essential people in the discussion and community detection methods to identify the communities and topics used in the discussion. Results show that @SaudiNews50, @Algassabinasser, and @Abdulrahman were top users in two networks, while @KingSalman and @LoujainHathloul were the top two users in another network. Consequently, “King Salman” and “Loujain Hathloul” Twitter accounts were identified as influencers, whereas “Saudi News” and “Algassabi Nasser” were the leading distributors of the news. Therefore, similar phenomena could be analyzed using the proposed framework to analyze similar behavior on other public discussions.}

abstract={Power companies are responsible for producing and transferring the required amount of electricity from grid stations to individual households. Many countries suffer huge losses in billions of dollars due to non-technical loss (NTL) in power supply companies. To deal with NTL, many machine learning classifiers have been employed in recent time. However, few has been studied about the performance evaluation metrics that are used in NTL detection to evaluate how good or bad the classifier is in predicting the non-technical loss. This paper first uses three classifiers: random forest, K-nearest neighbors and linear support vector machine to predict the occurrence of NTL in a real dataset of an electric supply company containing approximately 80,000 monthly consumption records. Then, it computes 14 performance evaluation metrics across the three classifiers and identify the key scientific relationships between them. These relationships provide insights into deciding which classifier can be more useful under given scenarios for NTL detection. This work can be proved to be a baseline not only for the NTL detection in power industry but also for the selection of appropriate performance evaluation metrics for NTL detection.}

abstract={Social Media (SM) platforms, particularly Twitter, have become useful tools for startup companies (henceforth startups) which use the latter to support most of their business activities. As a result, there is a need to gauge the performance of specific business initiatives vis-à-vis public sentiment, or more specifically the spread of such initiatives based on Twitter user-generated content. Previous research which makes use of Twitter analysis to analyze the business activities of startups is minimal, especially for Twitter user content in the Arabic language. Consequently, this paper proposes an analytics-based framework called Startup Initiatives Response Analysis (SIRA) designed to assess the performance of initiatives launched by startups via text classification, sentiment analysis, and statistical analysis techniques. To provide empirical evidence for the viability of the proposed research framework, this paper examined the case of an Arab transportation network startup, carrying out a SIRA analysis of an initiative undertaken by Careem to empower women by encouraging them to work for the company. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework for statistically measuring the initiative spread and the public feedback based on the user-generated content on the Twitter social platform.}

abstract={Sentiment classification is an active area of research with applications in many domains. Many researchers in the past have proposed techniques to identify sentiments with reasonable accuracy. However, the focus is more on the syntactic and semantic features of the documents. These features are effective but they ignore the user's past sentiments. In this research, we hypothesize that the past sentiments help the classifier to effectively link the user's history along with the contents of the current tweet. Thus, allowing learning algorithms to correlate past activities in determining the current sentiments. For this sake, we propose three sliding window features to accumulate past sentiments from the time series data. In this paper, we propose seven variations of Context-aware Sliding Window (CSW) features on different machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Furthermore, we propose a temporal dataset of user tweets, which is manually labeled by nine human annotators. The proposed dataset consists of 36 users having 4,557 tweets. Results indicate significant improvements over six state-of-the-art baseline methods.}

In this research we propose methods from network science to understand the relation between the subjects studied by a person and the impact of these subjects on the career of the person. We model the relation between favorite subjects and careers using a network. The model helps in understanding the positive and negative contributions of certain subjects towards other subjects and careers.

abstract={With the ever-growing demand of electric power, it is quite challenging to detect and prevent Non-Technical Loss (NTL) in power industries. NTL is committed by meter bypassing, hooking from the main lines, reversing and tampering the meters. Manual on-site checking and reporting of NTL remains an unattractive strategy due to the required manpower and associated cost. The use of machine learning classifiers has been an attractive option for NTL detection. It enhances data-oriented analysis and high hit ratio along with less cost and manpower requirements. However, there is still a need to explore the results across multiple types of classifiers on a real-world dataset. This paper considers a real dataset from a power supply company in Pakistan to identify NTL. We have evaluated 15 existing machine learning classifiers across 9 types which also include the recently developed CatBoost, LGBoost and XGBoost classifiers. Our work is validated using extensive simulations. Results elucidate that ensemble methods and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) outperform the other types of classifiers for NTL detection in our real dataset. Moreover, we have also derived a procedure to identify the top-14 features out of a total of 71 features, which are contributing 77\% in predicting NTL. We conclude that including more features beyond this threshold does not improve performance and thus limiting to the selected feature set reduces the computation time required by the classifiers. Last but not least, the paper also analyzes the results of the classifiers with respect to their types, which has opened a new area of research in NTL detection.}

abstract={In bibliometric and scientometric research, the quantitative assessment of scientific impact has boomed over the past few decades. Citations, being playing a major role in enhancing the impact of researchers, have become a very significant part of a plethora of new techniques for measuring scientific impact. Self-citations, though can be used genuinely to credit someone’s own work, can play a significant role in artificial manipulation of scientific impact. In this research, we study the impact of self-citations on enhancing the scientific impact of an author using a dataset retrieved from AMiner ranging from 1936 to 2014 from the computer science domain. We investigated the relations among trends of self-citation and their influence on scientific impact. We also studied its influence on ranking metrics including author impact factor and H-Index. By analyzing self-citations over time, we discover five basic self-citation trends, which are early, middle, later, multi and none. Distinctly different patterns were observed in self-citations trends. The results show that self-citations, if totally removed from total received citations, negatively influence the AIF and H-Index values and hence can be used to artificially boost the scientific impact. We used regression-based prediction models to predict the influence of self-citations on future H-Index. Classifiers including Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes and K-NN were used with an accuracy of 93\%, 73\% and 60\% respectively.}

This paper is a content analysis that seeks to systematize the studies carried out on the use of social media in the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Twenty-four studies were reviewed using a synthesis-and-interpretation-based approach. The results of the content analysis reveal the effectiveness of social media in connecting the key actors in the entrepreneurial ecosystem such as such as partners, suppliers, universities, and resource providers in many aspects. The available literature suggests that social media-Twitter and Facebook-in particular-have been the most platforms used by entrepreneurs. Startups presence in social media more than established companies. Social media affects positively on startups’ performance. The use of social media in the entrepreneurial ecosystem is affected by a number of variables, such as the organization culture, region, gender, age, and business environment. Moreover, most of the studies follow a quantitative approach, to measure frequency of the use of social media by SMEs. The relevance of this study lies in the fact that it illuminates future research as it identifies the research gaps in the use of social media as a communication channel between Small and Medium Enterprise SMEs and other stakeholders in the entrepreneurship ecosystem.}

This has been achieved by employing the different natural language processing (NLP) techniques along with the aid of the various deep learning approaches and architectures. Using the distributed word representations to substitute the traditional bag-of-words approach has been utilized very efficiently in the last years for many NLP tasks. In this paper, we present the detailed steps of building a set of efficient word embedding models called ArWordVec that are generated from a huge repository of Arabic tweets. In addition, a new method for measuring Arabic word similarity is introduced that has been used in evaluating the performance of the generated ArWordVec models. The experimental results show that the performance of the ArWordVec models overcomes the recently available models on Arabic Twitter data for the word similarity task. In addition, two of the large Arabic tweets datasets are used to examine the performance of the proposed models in the multi-class sentiment analysis task. The results show that the proposed models are very efficient and help in achieving a classification accuracy ratio exceeding 73.86\% with a high average F1 value of 74.15.}

In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Weighted Dynamic Heartbeat Graph (WDHG) to detect events from the Twitter stream. Once an event is detected in a Twitter stream, WDHG suppresses it in later stages, in order to detect new emerging events. This unique characteristic makes the proposed approach sensitive to capture emerging events efficiently. Experiments are performed on three real-life benchmark datasets: FA Cup Final 2012, Super Tuesday 2012, and the US Elections 2012. Results show considerable improvement over existing event detection methods in most cases.}

abstract={With increasing popularity of social media, Twitter has become one of the leading platforms to report events in real-time. Detecting events from Twitter stream requires complex techniques. Event-related trending topics consist of a group of words which successfully detect and identify events. Event detection techniques must be scalable and robust, so that they can deal with the huge volume and noise associated with social media. Existing event detection methods mostly rely on burstiness, mainly the frequency of words and their co-occurrences. However, burstiness sometimes dominates other relevant details in the data which could be equally significant. Besides, the topological and temporal relationships in the data are often ignored. In this work, we propose a novel graph-based approach, called the Enhanced Heartbeat Graph (EHG), which detects events efficiently. EHG suppresses dominating topics in the subsequent data stream, after their first detection. Experimental results on three real-world datasets (i.e., Football Association Challenge Cup Final, Super Tuesday, and the US Election 2012) show superior performance of the proposed approach in comparison to the state-of-the-art techniques.}

We classify techniques and methodologies according to event types, orientation of content, event detection tasks, their evaluation, and common practices. We highlight the limitations of existing techniques and accordingly propose solutions to address the shortcomings. We propose a framework called EDoT based on the research trends, common practices, and techniques used for detecting events on Twitter. EDoT can serve as a guideline for developing event detection methods, especially for researchers who are new in this area. We also describe and compare data collection techniques, the effectiveness and shortcomings of various Twitter and non-Twitter-based features, and discuss various evaluation measures and benchmarking methodologies. Finally, we discuss the trends, limitations, and future directions for detecting events on Twitter.}

abstract={Social networking sites play a significant role in altmetrics. While 90\% of all altmetric mentions come from Twitter, the known microscopic and macroscopic properties of Twitter altmetrics data are limited. In this study, we present a large-scale analysis of Twitter altmetrics data using social network analysis techniques on the ‘mention’ network of Twitter users. Exploiting the network-level properties of over 1.4 million tweets, corresponding to 77,757 scholarly articles, this study focuses on the following aspects of Twitter altmetrics data: (a) the influence of organizational accounts; (b) the formation of disciplinary communities; (c) the cross-disciplinary interaction among Twitter users; (d) the network motifs of influential Twitter users; and (e) testing the small-world property. The results show that Twitter-based social media communities have unique characteristics, which may affect social media usage counts either directly or indirectly. Therefore, instead of treating altmetrics data as a black box, the underlying social media networks, which may either inflate or deflate social media usage counts, need further scrutiny.}

abstract={Deep learning (DL) has attracted increasing attention on account of its significant processing power in tasks, such as speech, image, or text processing. In order to the exponential development and widespread availability of digital social media (SM), analyzing these data using traditional tools and technologies is tough or even intractable. DL is found as an appropriate solution to this problem. In this paper, we keenly discuss the practiced DL architectures by presenting a taxonomy-oriented summary, following the major efforts made toward the SM analytics (SMA). Nevertheless, instead of the technical description, this paper emphasis on describing the SMA-oriented problems with the DL-based solutions. To this end, we also highlight the DL research challenges (such as scalability, heterogeneity, and multimodality) and future trends.}

abstract={MOOCs offer world-widely accessible online content typically including videos, readings, quizzes along with social communication tools on a platform that enables participants to learn at their own pace. The number of learners who sign up and attend the courses are exponentially growing. Consequently, MOOC platforms generate a large amount of data about their learners. Researchers use participants' digital traces to make sense of their engagement in a course and identify their needs to predict future patterns and to make interventions based on these patterns. The research reported here was conducted to further understand learners social engagement on a MOOC platform and the impact of engagement on course completion. The patterns of learners social engagement were modelled by using learning analytics techniques. The findings of this research show that the integrated social features such as commonly known follow features and deeper peer interactions have potential value in tracking, analysing, and generating insightful information related to participants' behaviours.}

abstract={Citation analysis is an important measure for the assessment of quality and impact of academic entities (authors, papers and publication venues) used for ranking of research articles, authors and publication venues. It is a common observation that high-level publication venues, with few exceptions (Nature, Science and PLOS ONE), are usually topic specific. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the claim correlation analysis between topic specificity and citation count of different types of publication venues (journals, conferences and workshops). The topic specificity was calculated using the information theoretic measure of entropy (which tells us about the disorder of the system). The authors computed the entropy of the titles of the papers published in each venue type to investigate their topic specificity. It was observed that venues usually with higher citations (high-level publication venues) have low entropy and venues with lesser citations (not-high-level publication venues) have high entropy. Low entropy means less disorder and more specific to topic and vice versa. The input data considered here were DBLP-V7 data set for the last 10 years. Experimental analysis shows that topic specificity and citation count of publication venues are negatively correlated to each other. This paper is the first attempt to discover correlation between topic sensitivity and citation counts of publication venues. It also used topic specificity as a feature to rank academic entities.}

abstract={Web 2.0 or social web applications such as online discussion forums, blogs and Wikipedia have improved knowledge sharing by providing an environment in which users can generate and find their favorite content in, a flexible way. With the passage of time, online discussion forums accumulate a huge amount of content and this can introduce issues of content quality and user credibility. A poor-quality answer in a discussion forum indicates the presence of unprofessional or unqualified users; therefore, a priority is to find experts or reputable users. Most of the existing expert-ranking approaches consider basic features, such as the total number of answers provided by a user, but ignore the quality and consistency of the user's answer. In this paper, expert-ranking techniques using g-index are proposed, and are applied to a StackOverflow forum dataset. Three techniques are proposed including Exp-PC, Rep-FS and Weighted Exp-PC. Exp-PC is an adaptation of g-index for ranking experts in StackOverflow forum. In Rep-FS, several features like voters reputation, vote ratio are proposed to measure users' expertise while Weighted Exp-PC computes user expertise by combining their Exp-PC and Rep-FS scores. We measure users' reputation and expertise according to both the quality of their answer and their consistency in providing quality answers. The experimental results of the proposed expert-ranking techniques, Exp-PC and Weighted Exp-PC in particular, validate that these methods identify genuine experts in a more effective way.}

abstract={In this article we present a new semantic and syntactic-based method for external plagiarism detection. In the proposed approach, latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) and parts of speech (POS) tags are used together to detect plagiarism between the sample and a number of source documents. The basic hypothesis is that considering semantic and syntactic information between two text documents may improve the performance of the plagiarism detection task. Our method is based on two steps, naming, which is a pre-processing where we detect the topics from the sentences in documents using the LDA and convert each sentence in POS tags array; then a post processing step where the suspicious cases are verified purely on the basis of semantic rules. For two types of external plagiarism (copy and random obfuscation), we empirically compare our approach to the state-of-the-art N-gram based and stop-word N-gram based methods and observe significant improvements.

Moreover, we present an initial relational framework between these disciplines and suggest how these relations can be exploited to solve problems in each area. This paper argues for (a) the particular importance of the abstract class of ‘learning machines’ for Web science, (b) understanding cognitive computation as a necessary practical framework for the increasingly dominating, situated informal learning context, and (c) the potential benefit of Web science frameworks for investigating both, contemporary research questions in e-learning and the development of theories for informal ubiquitous learning. Finally, we argue that exploring links between these disciplines is necessary for improving practical research, for the purpose of developing learning-analytics methodology for evaluating the growing types of modern e-learning contexts such as the informal situated learning context.}}

abstract={A community structure is an integral part of a social network. Detecting such communities plays an important role in a wide range of applications, including but not limited to cluster analysis, recommendation systems and understanding the behaviour of complex systems. Researchers have derived many algorithms to discover the community structures of networks. Discovering communities is a challenging task, and there is no single algorithm that produces the best results for all networks. Therefore, despite many elegant solutions, discovering communities remains an active area of research. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, the Clustering Coefficient-based Genetic Algorithm (CC-GA), for detecting them in social and complex networks. Researchers have used several genetic algorithms to detect communities, but the proposed algorithm is novel in terms of both the generation of the initial population and the mutation method, and these improve its efficiency and accuracy. Experiments on a variety of real-world datasets and a comparison to state-of-the-art genetic and non-genetic-based algorithms show improved results.}

Reciprocal link prediction in citations networks refers toward inferring about getting a citation from an author, whose work is already cited by you. The paper aims to discuss these issues. In this paper, the authors study the extent to which the information of a two-way citation relationship (called reciprocal) is predictable. The authors propose seven different features based on papers, their authors and citations of each paper to predict reciprocal links. Extensive experiments are performed on CiteSeer data set by using three classification algorithms (decision trees, Naive Bayes, and support vector machines) to analyze the impact of individual, category wise and combination of features. The results reveal that it is likely to precisely predict 96 percent of reciprocal links. The study delivers convincing evidence of presence of the underlying equilibrium amongst reciprocal links. It is not a generic method for link prediction which can work for different networks with relevant features and parameters. This paper predicts the reciprocal links to show who is citing your work to collaborate with them in future. The proposed method will be helpful in finding collaborators and developing academic links. The proposed method uses reciprocal link prediction for bibliographic networks in a novel way.}

abstract={Tags are used to annotate resources on social media platforms. Most tag recommendation methods use popular tags, but in the case of new resources that are as yet untagged (the cold start problem), popularity-based tag recommendation methods fail to work. The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel model for tag recommendation called multi-feature space latent Dirichlet allocation (MFS-LDA) for cold start problem. MFS-LDA is a novel latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)-based model which exploits multiple feature spaces (title, contents, and tags) for recommending tags. Exploiting multiple feature spaces allows MFS-LDA to recommend tags even if data from a feature space is missing (the cold start problem). Evaluation of a publicly available data set consisting of around 20,000 Wikipedia articles that are tagged on a social bookmarking website shows a significant improvement over existing LDA-based tag recommendation methods. The originality of MFS-LDA lies in segregation of features for removing bias toward dominant features and in synchronization of multiple feature space for tag recommendation.}

In this article, the authors propose a framework CommuniMents which enables us to identify the members of a community and measure the sentiments of the community for a particular event. CommuniMents uses automated snowball sampling to identify the members of a community, then fetches their published contents (specifically tweets), pre-processes the contents and measures the sentiments of the community.

One not so well studied aspect of social media is analyzing its usage and efficacy in healthcare, particularly in developing countries which lack state-of-the-art healthcare systems and processes. In such countries, social media may be used to facilitate patient-centric healthcare by involving the patient for fulfilling personal healthcare needs. This article provides an in-depth analysis of one such need, that is, how people use social media to request for blood donations. We study the request and dissemination behavior of people using social media to fulfill blood donation requests. We focus on twitter, and blood donation accounts in India. Our study reveals that each of the seven twitter accounts we studied have a large followership of more than 35,000 users on an average and receive a substantial number (more than 900) of donation requests in a day on an average. We analyze the requests in various ways to present an outlook for healthcare providers to make their systems more patient-centric through a better understanding of the needs of people requesting for blood donations. Our study also identifies areas where future social media enabled automated healthcare systems can focus on the needs of individual patients. These systems can provide support for saving more lives by reducing the gap between blood donors and the people in need.}

Due to the resulting exponential growth of the social web, a number of research domains have emerged, involving research activities that aim to study human nature, to analyse human sentiments and emotions, and to find the impact of various users in the social networks. Recently, the research focus has shifted to identifying a user's influence on other users in a social network. In the recent literature, we find a number of models proposed to find the most influential users in the blogging community. In this paper, we review the models to find these influential bloggers. The existing models are classified into feature-based and network-based categories. The feature-based models consider the salient factors to measure bloggers' influence. The network models, on the other hand, consider the graph-based social network structure of the bloggers to identify those who have the most impact on fellow members. This survey introduces each model with its features, novel aspects, and the datasets used. In addition to the discussion about the model, a comparative analysis of the datasets is presented. We conclude by discussing applications of the relevant literature, exploring open research issues and challenges, and sharing possible future directions in this active area of research.}
