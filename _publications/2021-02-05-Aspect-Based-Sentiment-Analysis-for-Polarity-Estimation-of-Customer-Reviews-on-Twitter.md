Most consumers read online reviews written by different users before making purchase decisions, where each opinion expresses some sentiment. Therefore, sentiment analysis is currently a hot topic of research. In particular, aspect-based sentiment analysis concerns the exploration of emotions, opinions and facts that are expressed by people, usually in the form of polarity. It is crucial to consider polarity calculations and not simply categorize reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. Currently, the available lexicon-based method accuracy is affected by limited coverage. Several of the available polarity estimation techniques are too general and may not reflect the aspect/topic in question if reviews contain a wide range of information about different topics. This paper presents a model for the polarity estimation of customer reviews using aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA-PER). ABSA-PER has three major phases: data preprocessing, aspect co-occurrence calculation (CAC) and polarity estimation. A multi-domain sentiment dataset, Twitter dataset, and trust pilot forum dataset (developed by us by defined judgement rules) are used to verify ABSA-PER. Experimental outcomes show that ABSA-PER achieves better accuracy, i.e., 85.7\% accuracy for aspect extraction and 86.5\% accuracy in terms of polarity estimation, than that of the baseline methods.
