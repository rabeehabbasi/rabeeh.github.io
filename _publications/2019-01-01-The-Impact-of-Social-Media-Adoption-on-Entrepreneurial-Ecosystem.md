Since entrepreneurial is important driving for economic growth, researchers should be helpful to develop greater strategic insight into innovation technology in this group. This paper is a content analysis that seeks to systematize the studies carried out on the use of social media in the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Twenty-four studies were reviewed using a synthesis-and-interpretation-based approach. The results of the content analysis reveal the effectiveness of social media in connecting the key actors in the entrepreneurial ecosystem such as such as partners, suppliers, universities, and resource providers in many aspects. The available literature suggests that social media-Twitter and Facebook-in particular-have been the most platforms used by entrepreneurs. Startups presence in social media more than established companies. Social media affects positively on startupsâ€™ performance. The use of social media in the entrepreneurial ecosystem is affected by a number of variables, such as the organization culture, region, gender, age, and business environment. Moreover, most of the studies follow a quantitative approach, to measure frequency of the use of social media by SMEs. The relevance of this study lies in the fact that it illuminates future research as it identifies the research gaps in the use of social media as a communication channel between Small and Medium Enterprise SMEs and other stakeholders in the entrepreneurship ecosystem.
