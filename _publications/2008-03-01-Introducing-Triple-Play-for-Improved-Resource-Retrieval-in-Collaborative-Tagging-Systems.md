Collaborative tagging systems (like Flickr, del.icio.us, citeulike, etc.) are becoming more popular with passage of time. Users share their resources on tagging systems, and add keywords (called tags) to these resources. Users can search resources using these tags. But as the user gives more tags for search, he might not get sufficient search results, because the resources might not be tagged with all the related tags. We introduce the method Triple Play, which smoothes the tag space by user space for improved retrieval of resources. As a part of Triple Play, we also propose two new vector space models for collaborative tagging systems, SmoothVSM Dense and SmoothVSM Sparse. These vector space models exploit the user-tag co-occurrence relationship to overcome the problem of missing information in tagging systems. Finally we apply Latent Semantic Analysis to different vector space models and analyze the results. Initial experimentation show that using additional information available in tagging systems helps in improving search in tagging systems.
