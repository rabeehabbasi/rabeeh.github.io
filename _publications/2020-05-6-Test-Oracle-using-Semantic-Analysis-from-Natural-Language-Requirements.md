Automation of natural language based applications is a challenging task due to its semantics. This challenge is also confronted in the software testing field. In this paper, we provide a systematic literature review related to the semantic analysis of natural language requirements in the software testing field. The literature review assisted us in the identification of the substantial research gap related to the semantics-based natural language test oracle. To the best of our knowledge, we have not found any technique in which the semantics of test oracle from natural language requirements can be solved using Word Sense Disambiguation techniques. We have discussed our proposed approach to generate semantics-based test oracle from natural language requirements. Our proposed approach can be applied to any domain.
