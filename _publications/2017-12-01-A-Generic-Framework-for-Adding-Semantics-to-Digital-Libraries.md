The World Wide Web (WWW) is emerging as the Web of Data, providing information on various domains. A vast number of scientific documents such as books, articles and journals can be found through many publisherâ€™s websites, portals and XML exports. The challenge here is that the data about these scientific documents can not be explored collectively, as they are published as a bounded group of sources organized by different publishers. To address these limitations, we have developed a generic framework termed as Linked Open Publications Data Framework (LOPDF) that facilitates crawling, processing, extracting and producing machine-processable data that is open and linked to other open datasets. We also demonstrate the RDF datasets produced by using LOPDF framework and describe statistics of different datasets entities.
