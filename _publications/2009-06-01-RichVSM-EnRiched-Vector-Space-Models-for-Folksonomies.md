People share millions of resources (photos, bookmarks, videos, etc.) in Folksonomies (like Flickr, Delicious, Youtube, etc.). To access and share resources, they add keywords called tags to the resources. As the tags are freely chosen keywords, it might not be possible for users to tag their resources with all the relevant tags. As a result, many resources lack sufficient number of relevant tags. The lack of relevant tags results into sparseness of data, and this sparseness of data makes many relevant resources unsearchable against user queries.
