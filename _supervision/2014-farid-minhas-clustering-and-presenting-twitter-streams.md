Clustering and Presenting Twitter Streams by Farid Minhas (2014)

Social media has emerged as an effective mean for social awareness in the society. Millions of posts are shared everyday on popular social media websites. Twitter is a popular microblogging service used by millions of users. It is also popular among researchers because of its publicly available posts. Researchers worked on different aspects of twitter. Twitter provides a keywords-based search facility. The results against given keywords are presented to the user. The search results do not provide a diverse understanding of the presented tweets. In this thesis, we propose a framework to categorize twitter search results. Categorization provides a diverse understanding about the tweets. Experimental results show improvements in understanding of tweets when using the proposed framework.
