Information over the Internet is being produced and propagated not just on traditional, static websites, but also increasingly via weblogs and online social networks. Twitter along with other microblogging solutions has grown to become a vital supply of information in todayâ€™s web. In this thesis, we study and analyze the presence of Pakistani Politicians. First we identify the Pakistani politicians who have presence on Twitter. Then we study Social Network aspects of these politicians. We identify the opinion of general public about the politicians who follow the politicians as well as their opinion related to other political parties.
