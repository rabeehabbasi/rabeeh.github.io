Discovering Expert Groups in Pakistan Research Community by Faisal Imran (2016)

This thesis analyzes the co-authorship pattern of Pakistani researchers. We particularly focus on communities of researchers working in different domains. We discover researchers who work in multiple domains and provide a bridge across multiple do- mains. For this purpose we proposed a framework for finding groups of Pakistani research community. The framework uses readily available tools for social network analysis of Pakistani research community. The results provide interesting insight of the research community.
