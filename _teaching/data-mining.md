Aims and Objectives
======
The purpose of this course is to give students a hands-on experience of data mining. The course covers basic topics in data mining: data processing, pattern mining, classification, and cluster analysis. To get maximum benefit out of this course, students will be provided with real life datasets to perform the data mining tasks learned during the course. After completing the course, students should be able to perform general data mining tasks on real life datasets.
