Aims and Objectives
======
Data structures are used to store and retrieve data efficiently. The main purpose of this course is to understand basic data structures and algorithms associated with these data structures. The course covers a wide range of data structures and their applications for solving various problems. At the end of the course, students should be able to implement basic data structures, compare performance of various data structures, and use appropriate data structures to solve a variety of problems.
