Aims and Objectives
======
In today’s world almost everything is connected. With the help of social networking websites people are even more connected than ever. The objective of this course is to learn methods to analyze social networks. Methods that students will learn include: identifying important nodes in a network, detecting communities, modeling social networks, analyzing information diffusion and opinion formation. Some of the methods can also be applied to networks not involving human relations like technological or semantic networks. At the end of the course, students will be able to apply the concepts covered in this course on real life and online social networks.
