abstract = "During the last two decades, the number of incidents from extremists have increased, so as the use of social media. Research suggests that extremists use social media for reaching their purposes like recruitment, fund raising, and propaganda. Limited research is available to identify rebel users on social media platforms. Therefore, we propose a Supervised Rebel Identification (SRI) framework to identify rebels on Twitter. The framework consists of a novel mechanism to structure the users’ tweets into a directed user graph. This user graph links predicates (verbs) with the subject and object words to understand semantics of the underlying data. We convert the user graph into graph embedding to use these semantics within the machine learning algorithms. Apart from the user graph and its embedding, we propose fourteen other features belonging to tweets’ contents and users’ profiles. For evaluation, we present the first multicultural and multiregional dataset of rebels affiliated with nine rebel movements belonging to five countries. We evaluate the proposed SRI framework against two state-of-the-art baselines. The results show that the SRI framework outperforms the baselines with high accuracy."

abstract = "Cross Site Scripting (XSS) is one of the most frequently occurring vulnerability. The impact of XSS can vary from cosmetic to catastrophic damages. However, detection of XSS efficiently is still an open issue. Cross site scripting has been dealt with static and dynamic analysis previously. Both techniques have shortcomings and fail due to frequent variations in XSS payloads. Therefore, in this paper, we have proposed the use of Genetic Algorithm (GA) along with Reinforcement Learning (RL) and threat intelligence to overcome XSS attacks. For validation, the proposed approach is applied on a real dataset of XSS attacks. Results show better performance of our proposed approach when compared to the approaches reported in the literature. In addition to better performance, our method is not only flexible to changes in XSS payloads, but the results are also more understandable to end users. Moreover, our approach shows improvement when the number of attacks is increased."
