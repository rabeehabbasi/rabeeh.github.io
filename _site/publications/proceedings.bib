    abstract={Automation of natural language based applications is a challenging task due to its semantics. This challenge is also confronted in the software testing field. In this paper, we provide a systematic literature review related to the semantic analysis of natural language requirements in the software testing field. The literature review assisted us in the identification of the substantial research gap related to the semantics-based natural language test oracle. To the best of our knowledge, we have not found any technique in which the semantics of test oracle from natural language requirements can be solved using Word Sense Disambiguation techniques. We have discussed our proposed approach to generate semantics-based test oracle from natural language requirements. Our proposed approach can be applied to any domain.}

It detects real-life events and related trending topics from the Twitter stream and allows users to find interesting events that have recently occurred. It uses a novel Dynamic Heartbeat Graph (DHG) approach, which efficiently extracts distinguishing features and performs better than the existing event detection methods. We tested and evaluated the application on three case studies, including a sports event (FA cup Final) and two political events (Super Tuesday and US Election).}

abstract={Over the years, many countries have faced huge financial deficits due to Non-Technical Loss (NTL) in power sector. There are many ways of attempting to illegal use of electricity like by-passing and reversing meters. There have been many attempts to bring down NTL using manual and automated techniques. Manual NTL detection is not proving fruitful as it incurs heavy costs and has a low hit ratio. Due to the shortcoming of manual NTL detection, automated detection of NTL using machine learning classifiers is gaining attention in the research community. The datasets containing NTL belong to the class imbalance domain where regular consumers (negative class) out weight the representation of irregular consumers (positive class). To identify the right number of representative records, many techniques are proposed but selecting the right features in deciding NTL is equally an important task where not much has been contributed to the literature. In this paper, we propose the Incremental Feature Selection (IFS) algorithm which first uses feature importance to identify the most relevant features for NTL detection and then these features are used to test three classifiers namely CatBoost, Decision Tree (DT) Classifier and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for NTL detection. This way, we have not only identified the most relevant features for NTL detection in a real dataset but also have brought down the overall computation time of the classifiers. Moreover, our proposed framework is tested on three performance evaluation metrics used in imbalance domain. The results show that using the most relevant features identified by the IFS algorithm, the three classifiers have the same or slightly better efficiency as compared to using all features.}

In this work, we propose a novel graph-based approach named the Dynamic Heartbeat Graph (DHG) that not only detects the events at an early stage, but also suppresses them in the upcoming adjacent data stream in order to highlight new emerging events. This characteristic makes the proposed method interesting and efficient in finding emerging events and related topics. The experiment results on real-world datasets (i.e. FA Cup Final and Super Tuesday 2012) show a considerable improvement in most cases, while time complexity remains very attractive.}

abstract={Players are ranked in various sports to show their importance over other players. Existing methods only consider intra-type links (e.g., player to player and team to team), but ignore inter-type links (e.g., one type of player to another type of player, such as batsman to bowler and player to team) based on cognitive aspects. They also ignore the spatiality of the players. There is a strong relationship among players and their teams, which can be represented as a network consisting of multi-type interrelated objects. In this paper, we propose a players' ranking method, called Region-wise Players Link Fusion (RPLF) which is applied to the sport of cricket. RPLF considers players' region-wise intra-type and inter-type relation-based features to rank the players. Considering multi-type interrelated objects is based on the intuition that a batsman scoring high against top bowlers of a strong team or a bowler taking wickets against top batsmen of a strong team is considered as a good player. The experimental results show that RPLF provides promising insights of players' rankings. RLFP is a generic method and can be applied to different sports for ranking players.}

The ability to predict a student's performance can be beneficial for actions in modern educational systems. Existing methods have used features which are mostly related to academic performance, family income and family assets; while features belonging to family expenditures and students' personal information are usually ignored. In this paper, an effort is made to investigate aforementioned feature sets by collecting the scholarship holding students' data from different universities of Pakistan. Learning analytics, discriminative and generative classification models are applied to predict whether a student will be able to complete his degree or not. Experimental results show that proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods due to exploitation of family expenditures and students' personal information feature sets. Outcomes of this EDM/LA research can serve as policy improvement method in higher education.}

This paper introduces a new method Weighted Mutual Influence Rank (WMIRank) for finding rising stars. WMIRank exploits influence of co-authors' citations, order of appearance and publication venues. Comprehensive experiments are performed to analyze the performance of WMIRank in comparison to baseline methods, which have ignored weighted mutual influence. AMiner data for years 1995-2000 is used for experiments. List of top 30 authors as per proposed and baseline methods are compared for their average number of papers, average number of citations and achievements.

The challenge here is that the data about these scientific documents can not be explored collectively, as they are published as a bounded group of sources organized by different publishers. To address these limitations, we have developed a generic framework termed as Linked Open Publications Data Framework (LOPDF) that facilitates crawling, processing, extracting and producing machine-processable data that is open and linked to other open datasets. We also demonstrate the RDF datasets produced by using LOPDF framework and describe statistics of different datasets entities.}

abstract={Twitter is a popular micro-blogging service for sharing short messages called tweets. Tweets provide public opinion on various topics. Currently twitter presents search results in form of a flat list, sorted either by popularity or by recency. These search results limit the possibility of identifying diverse latent topics covered by the tweets. One way to better understand the tweets is to cluster them where each cluster depicts a latent topic. Suitable clustering algorithms are required to cluster streaming data and map new data into existing clusters. To address this, we propose in this paper a framework called INTWEEMS (INcremental clustering of TWEEt streaMS) which clusters tweets in real-time, adjusts new tweets into existing clusters (incrementally), and provides visualization of clusters that helps in identifying latent topics and sub-topics within the tweets. This paper describes the INTWEEMS framework and its implementation.}

abstract={Early aspect mining captures the concerns that can propagate to other artifacts in later stage. However, current approaches and tools required a self made input by following specific grammatical patterns to expose to the approach what the concern is. Moreover, requirements are mostly communicated between the stakeholders in form of features. However, the early aspect mining from the feature introduced the labor intensive task of creating feature model that is unable to support cross-cutting relations. There seems to be a tradeoff between the requirement abstraction and automaticity for aspect discovery at early analysis phase. In this paper, we present an enhanced form of aspect-oriented feature analysis (AOFA), which discovers meaningful concerns and feature interactions, then associates them to feature modules without disbursing automaticity. It takes publically available unstructured features as input then creates a knowledge base of domain by natural language processing and finally models each feature's dependencies by utilizing this domain knowledge and variability patterns. We evaluate our approach against early aspect miner tool and statistical method and found our approach to be optimal.}}

In this paper we propose a new method to identify landmark photos using tags and social Flickr groups. In contrast to similar modern systems, our approach is also applicable when GPS-coordinates for photos are not available. Presented user study shows that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art systems for landmark finding.}

In our paper, we exploit these three kinds of image descriptions to suggest possible annotations for new images uploaded to a social tagging system. In order to compare the benefits each of these description types brings to a tag recommender system on its own, we investigate them independently of each other. First, the existing data collection is clustered separately for the geographical coordinates, tags, and low-level features. Additionally, random clustering is performed in order to provide a baseline for experimental results. Once a new image has been uploaded to the system, it is assigned to one of the clusters using either its geographical or low-level representation. Finally, the most representative tags for the resulting cluster are suggested to the user for annotation of the new image. Large-scale experiments performed for more than 400,000 images compare the different image representation techniques in terms of precision and recall in tag recommendation.}

We introduce the method Triple Play, which smoothes the tag space by user space for improved retrieval of resources. As a part of Triple Play, we also propose two new vector space models for collaborative tagging systems, SmoothVSM Dense and SmoothVSM Sparse. These vector space models exploit the user-tag co-occurrence relationship to overcome the problem of missing information in tagging systems.

abstract={Tagging systems (or folksonomies) like Flickr or Delicious are expanding tremendously. More and more resources are being added to them. As the resources present on these system increase in amount, it becomes difficult to explore these resources. For this purpose, we present a system T-ORG, which provides a mechanism to organize these resources by classifying the tags (or keywords) attached to them into predefined categories. Supervised classification in this case seems infeasible; therefore we also propose a new classification algorithm T-KNOW that does not require training data. For our experiments, we have downloaded images and their tags from groups present on Flickr website and then classified these tags into different categories. We have used Cohen’s Kappa and F-measure to evaluate the classification results of T-KNOW. Results are encouraging and show that T-ORG can be used to explore resources in an effective manner.}
